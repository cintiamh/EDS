Entertainment Design Studio (53-723)
====================================

Objective and Summary
---------------------

The objective of this semester project is to develop several independent HTML5 game prototypes in order to learn the technology and the existing libraries that exist at this time.

The Plan
--------

During the period of one semester, or 15 weeks, the plan is to develop at least four distinct game prototypes using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.
All games will be inspired by existing classic game titles and the idea is to verify how much is it possible to get close to a published title in terms of playability.
Each game prototype will ideally be more complex than the one before along the semester. My goal is to increment my knowledge not just with pure JavaScript, but also adding existing open source libraries in order to get more robust final products.
These projects will not focus on audio or art quality, but in playability and performance in an online and plugin-less environment.
All the source code will be available from my GitHub account page (https://github.com/cintiamh/EDS)
And all pieces will be published and available to be played at my portfolio (http://portfolio.pandajapa.com/) by the end of this semester.

**Classic games title suggestion:**
* Minesweeper (starting pure canvas and JavaScript)
* Space Invaders (animation and simple particles)
* Asteroids (with multiplayer - Node.js)
* Tetris 3D (with 3D rendering - Three.js)
